# Forest-Fire-Prevention-System

The Forest Fire Prevention System is a groundbreaking new system that uses cutting-edge technology to detect and prevent forest fires. It combines sensors, 
data communication technologies, and intelligent analysis algorithms to create a comprehensive and proactive fire detection and prevention network.

The system uses devices such as Arduino Nano with GSM/SIM module 4G, GPS/GPRS modules, and environmental sensors to collect real-time data on temperature, 
humidity, smoke, and other important factors. This data is then sent to an IoT server, where it is processed and analysed using advanced 
algorithms to identify potential fire outbreaks and fire-prone areas.

The IoT server acts as the central hub for the system. It uses rule-based decision-making to automatically trigger alerts and coordinate responses to potential fire threats. 
The server also allows for remote monitoring of the system and integration with external systems, such as fire department dispatch systems. Data visualisation tools 
and reports generated by the system provide valuable insights to help decision-makers understand fire risk levels, identify trends, and optimise the system's performance.
